## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learnt how to display items and arranging them in a way that ensures all elements are visible to the user.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:


```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px)
{

    body{
        width: 100%;
        height: 100vh;
    }
    .container{
        width: 280px;
        height: 100%;
        align-items: center;
        margin: auto;
    }
```

### Continued development

I will continue focusing on grid in CSS and also CSS in general.

### Useful resources
